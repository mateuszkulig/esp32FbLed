## How to build & run
It is recommended to use ESP-IDF plugin for VSCode, but you can also compile from command line using instructions from [ESP-IDF documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.1/esp32s3/api-guides/build-system.html).

1. ESP-IDF: Add vscode configuration folder
2. ESP-IDF: Build, Flash and start a monitor on your device

You can also run this two macrose using buttons from panel at the bottom of VSCode with the plugin installed.
